## 🔍 Solved Problems

You can view all solved problems inside their folders:

- **Arrays** → `LeetCode/Arrays/`
- **Strings** → `LeetCode/Strings/`
- **Math** → `LeetCode/Math/`
- **BinaryTree** → `LeetCode/BinaryTree/`
- **DynamicProgramming** → `LeetCode/DynamicProgramming/`

Problems are automatically organized by LeetCode ID.

## ▶️ How to Use

1. Navigate to a topic folder (Arrays / Strings / Trees / DP…)
2. Open the file named with its LeetCode problem ID  
   Example: 0058-length-of-last-word.py
3. Copy the code into LeetCode and run it  
4. Review time/space complexity inside the file  
5. Commit your solution to this repository

## 🎯 Naming Convention

All solution files follow the naming pattern:

```
<problemID>-<short-name>.py
```

Examples:
```
0058-length-of-last-word.py
0027-remove-element.py
0001-two-sum.py
```
